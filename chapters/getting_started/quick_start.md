# Quick Start

Installing CloudGoBrrr is very easy. We recommend using Docker Compose and a Reverse Proxy as your preferred way of installation.

This way you will have the most easiest to maintain while not giving up any security like HTTPS.

1. Install CloudGoBrrr using [Docker Compose](chapters/getting_started/install_docker_compose.md)
2. Setup a [Reverse Proxy](chapters/getting_started/reverse_proxy.md)
